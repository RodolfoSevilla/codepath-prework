2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   One of the biggest challenges for me for this prework submission was understanding what was document.getElementByID. 
   It was giving me a hard time understanding the Document Object Model but by reading closer the documentation I understood 
   that it is for browser updates and display and the various properties and elements in CSS, Javascript and HTML. 
   DOM is an object based on the HTML document called DOM. Using this DOM, we make changes to various elements inside the HTML document. 
   The other challenge was making the gif as I was confused of what was the shot of the gif we had to make. 
   I believe it was the output of win lose and user guess. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   The questions I have after my submission is what are all the Built-in Methods for all the languages? From my background with Java and C, 
   which Built-in Methods are similar? In Javascript I had a question on what was the difference between the different variables from other languages. 
   How should I start a project? What other languages can be added? I question my skill if I was able to do this project but from my past experience 
   I was able to have a basic understanding of what is similar to my previous language. Most of my questions were answered in the documentation as it
   gave me a great foundation to understand all three languages. 


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
 If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would like to make the project more unique by adding a hover function for the buttons like start and stop. 
 I would have liked to have more time to change the font and interface of the game to have a menu.  I would also utilize the time to  
 research how to try different sounds.
